# Project Overview

In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data.  We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather.  You can customize this to your own location.  Then, we'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning.  We'll build a system to make historical predictions.  Then, we'll add more predictors to improve the model.  We'll end with how to make next-day predictions.

**Project Steps**
* Download weather data
* Clean and graph data
* Create a testing framework
* Improve model accuracy
